#### Project Title: **CryptoGuard: A Secure File Mapping and Retrieval System**

---

#### Overview
CryptoGuard is a Python-based project designed to ensure secure storage and retrieval of sensitive files using advanced encryption and image-based chunk mapping techniques. The system utilizes a large collection of images as storage containers for encrypted file chunks, providing an innovative and secure solution. By integrating MongoDB as the backend database, CryptoGuard offers a scalable, robust, and efficient file management approach for sensitive data.

#### Key Features
1. **File Upload and Encryption**:  
   - Uploaded files are encrypted and divided into smaller chunks.  
   - Each chunk is mapped to a unique image from a preloaded folder.  

2. **Extensive Image Library**:  
   - The system requires an **images folder containing at least 1000 images or more**.  
   - These images serve as chunk storage locations, enhancing scalability and randomness in mapping.

3. **JSON Mapping File**:  
   - The relationships between file chunks and their respective images are recorded in a JSON mapping file.  
   - The JSON file is encrypted for added security.

4. **Database Integration**:  
   - MongoDB is used to store the encrypted JSON file, ensuring secure and efficient management of mapping data.

5. **Seamless File Retrieval**:  
   - Using the mapping details in the database, the original file is reconstructed effortlessly.

6. **Scalability and Flexibility**:  
   - The system supports folders with thousands of images, making it suitable for large-scale operations.

#### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Framework**: Tkinter (for GUI)  
- **Database**: MongoDB  
- **Encryption**: Advanced encryption algorithms for secure storage  
- **File Processing**: Chunking and image-based mapping

#### How It Works
1. **User Interface**:  
   - A Tkinter-based GUI provides buttons for uploading files, mapping to images, and retrieving the original file.

2. **Image Folder Requirement**:  
   - Users must provide an **images folder with at least 1000 images or more** for optimal performance and scalability.  
   - This large collection of images enhances the system's randomness and security.

3. **File Mapping**:  
   - Files are divided into chunks, each chunk is encrypted, and mapped to specific images in the folder.  
   - Mapping details are recorded in an encrypted JSON file stored in MongoDB.

4. **File Retrieval**:  
   - The system reconstructs the original file by retrieving mapping details from MongoDB and decrypting the data chunks.
